<samp>
    I'm Kaylynn, in case you hadn't realised that already.
    I like to program in my spare time but I'm not very good at it. I guess I get to call myself a full-stack developer since I made a website once?

    If for some reason you weant to talk to me, you can find me on discord or twitter with the handles listed on the left - they are on the left, right?
